## About me
After my degree and PhD at Oxford University, I moved into Risk in a bank where I used Excel on a daily basis. Despite being good, I still was drowning in manual work. Then in 5 weeks, I decided to teach myself VBA and built a VBA userform and MS Access database application that automated 75% of my role.

I changed role to process automation, remaining in the business (not in Tech), where I used a range of low code applications to build my solutions for all departments withn the firm. I used a mixture of Excel, PowerQuery, VBA, MS Access, Alteryx, Tableau, PowerBI, PowerApps, Dataverse, and BluePrism (RPA).

In 2022, I moved from the business into a Technology team as a Software Engineer.

## My content
My aim is to build up 3 main areas of contents:
- **Everyday Excel**: a course which is designed to be everything you need in the workplace (in development) and other advanced Excel tips (via social media).
- **MS Power Platform**: tips for both non-tech (citzen developers) on how to extend your Excel knowledge into Power Platform, and looking into fusion development - extending Power Platform with code.
- **Tech for non-Tech**: tips on common knowledge gaps for people entering into technology roles from non-Tech backgrounds.

## My goals
### Excel
During my time in my process automation role, when working with the teams I was building solutions for, I became aware of the most common knowledge gaps (e.g. Power Query) in Excel most people have in the workplace. Not only the gaps, but the misinformation online about what was needed to become good at Excel such as the need to learn all keyboard shorcuts. When looking at the courses available, I felt there was a gap in the market to develop a one-stop shop showing you all you needed to know in 1 place, rather than courses split into small segments. How do you know which segments you need and how they relate so you can automate your work? So I've developed a course for all you need to know in the workplace to not just save you a bit of time in your tasks, but how to automate your tasks. I also share other Excel content on social media for more niche or advanced tips but also how Excel knowledge can be applied to Power Platform for citizen developers.

### MS Power Platform - fusion dev
After I moved into a Technology team, I noticed the opposite knowledge gap: low code tools in Technology teams. Not all products require complex solutions. For internal process - where there are hundreds or more in most firms - a simple, quick solution built using low code tools such as Power Platform can meet all the required needs. As such, I'll share my research on fusion development and integrations of Power Platform with Azure.

### Tech for non-Tech
After I moved into a Technology team, I noticed the majority of people have been coding from a young age, and so, have a solid foundation of technical knowledge. I did not have any technical knowledge foundations. I'd never used Git, I'd only ever worked with files and have no idea what happens over the internet or what happends in your browser, and more. As such, as I develop this foundation, I'll document this as a resouce for non-Tech people trying to get into or learn technology.
